 * @section DESCRIPTION
 *
 * C library to ease serial communication with Arduino microcontrollers,
 * especially sending and receiving numeric data to/from an Arduino
 * via UART/serial/USB. Also included in this library are functions
 * to convert string data into numeric types. Libuino allows for both
 * processed character data and unprocessed raw numeric data transfers.
 * In order to write C applications that will interface with an arduino,
 * simply include libuino.h in the code you write for the PC side of
 * the serial connection.
 *
 * In order to send and receive text/character data, simply create
 * a new ino_connection_t object using the ino_connection_new()
 * function.  With this character-oriented configuration, you may
 * call ino_read() to read a string.  If the string returning from
 * the Arduino is known to be a space-delimited string of numeric
 * values, then you may use the ino_cast_int(), ino_cast_long(),
 * ino_cast_float(), and ino_cast_double() functions to quickly
 * cast them to numeric types according to their position number.
 * Although if normally reading all numeric values in the order they
 * appear, you may find using the standard C functions strtol(),
 * strtof(), and strtod() slightly faster if that is important.
 * The ino_cast_*() functions are quite convenient though especially
 * for quickly grabbing a value at a specific position in the string
 * without having to count white-spaces.
 
 * In order to transfer raw, unprocessed bytes, you should use the
 * ino_connection_raw() function to create a ino_connection_t object.
 * The "raw" functions will send and receive 16-bit and 32-bit signed
 * or unsigned integers. All integers are converted to network byte
 * order (i.e., big endian) for sending and then back into host byte
 * order when receiving integer data. To use the raw data functions
 * in the library, more than likely you will also want to include
 * arduino_libuino.h in most sketches that will need to interface
 * with the libuino library through the serial port.

 * be terminated by a new line (line feed) character.  This connection can be
 * opened and closed as many times as you like, but must be freed from memory

 * Arduino model does not automatically reboot each time a serial connection is

 * use INO_NO_WAIT for your connect_wait for faster connection times.  You may
 * also use INO_DEFAULT_WAIT which should be a safe number of microseconds to
 * wait for the Arduino to reboot before trying to configure the connection.
